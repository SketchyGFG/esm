general:
  useRamdisk: True # True|False. if True, use a ramdisk for the savegame. Requires the user to call ramdisk-install and ramdisk-setup to work. Will completely solve your server performance issues.

ramdisk:
  drive: "R:" # string. the drive letter to use for the ramdisk, e.g. "R:"
  size: "2G" # string. ramdisk size to use, e.g. '5G' or '32G', etc. If you change this, the ramdisk needs to be re-mounted, and the setup needs to run again.

server:
  dedicatedYaml: 'esm-dedicated.yaml' # string. path to dedicated yaml, make sure this is the one defined in EAH if you use that

backups:
  additionalBackupPaths: # list of full paths to source files or directories to backup additionally. Those will all end up in the folder "Additional" in the backup.
    - 'D:/Servers/Empyrion/Content/Mods/EncryptoidModPack' # the whole modpack
    - 'D:/Servers/Tools/esm/esm-custom-config.yaml' # our own configuration

updates: 
  scenariosource: D:/Servers/Scenarios   # source directory with the scenario folders that will be used to copy to the servers scenario folder
  additional: # additional stuff to copy when calling the esm game-update command
    # If a path is relative, it will be assumed to be relative to the installation path.
    # source path globs (wildcards) are supported
    # if dst does not exist and is not a directory, a directory with that name will be created and used as target for the source.
    # if src is a directory, it will be copied recursively into the target folder.
    # existing files/directories in the target will be overwritten!
    #
    # copy all item icons from the scenario to EAH
    - {src: 'D:/Servers/Scenarios/ProjectA/SharedData/Content/Bundles/ItemIcons/*.*', dst: 'D:/Servers/Empyrion/DedicatedServer/EmpyrionAdminHelper/Items/'}
    # copy custom sqlqueries to the game config
    - {src: 'D:/Servers/Misc/server_rankings/SqlQueries_disabled.txt', dst: 'D:/Servers/Empyrion/Content/Configuration/SqlQueries.txt'}


deletes:
  additionalDeletes: # additional paths of stuff to delete when using the "deleteall" command
    # paths to files/directories could point to like mod data, etc.. This accepts filesystem globbing (wildcards) like *.dat or similar.
    # if a path is relative, it will be assumed to be relative to the installation path.
    - 'Content/Mods/EncryptoidModPack/Mods/AdminTetherport/Database'

paths:
  install: 'D:/Servers/Empyrion/' # the games main installation location
  osfmount: 'D:/Servers/Tools/OSFMount/osfmount.com' # path to osfmount executable needed to mount the ram drive

  empremoteclient: 'D:/Servers/Tools/esm/emprc/EmpyrionPrime.RemoteClient.Console.exe' # path to emprc, used to send commands to the server
  eah: 'D:/Servers/Empyrion/DedicatedServer/EmpyrionAdminHelper' # path to EAH, for backing up its data
  steamcmd: 'D:/Servers/Tools/steamcmd/steamcmd.exe' # path to steamcmd for installs and updates of the game server

downloadtool:
  serverPort: 27440                                     # port of the webserver to listen to. Make sure you this port is reachable from outside

galaxy:
  territories: # custom faction territory definitions, esm will read out the galaxy config dynamically - used for the wipe-tool (check 'esm tool-wipe --showterritories')
     - faction: "MyCustomTerritory"
